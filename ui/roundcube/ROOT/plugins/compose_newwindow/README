compose_newwindow changes the behavior of the default compose / reply /
forward buttons in the main mail list so that they open the new message in 
a separate window (or tab depending on your browser settings)

The compose window is also slightly modified (using a css file) to hide
the main toolbar and move the rest of the items up accordingly.

Note: in order for this to work properly you may have to disable the
popup blocker in your browser for the webmail site.

If you are using a custom skin the plugin will look in the 
plugins/compose_newwindow/skins directory for corresponding
subdirectories and use the file compose.css from that directory
if found.

Installation
------------
Add the plugin to your config/main.inc.php

Configuration
-------------
The plugins default options can be set by copying the config.in.php.dist
file to config.inc.php in the plugin directory and editing the file.

ChangeLog:
20110822 - Updates to handle roundcube 6 beta changes to addressbook
           and built in foward as attachment option.
           Changes to old forward as Attachment plugin handling code.
           Updates to handling of contextmenu plugin handling.
           Incorporate changes from myroundcube.
           Change to default  options file to hopefully fix issues 
           where it wasn't possible to turn the option off in settings.

ToDo: 
- Get message list to reload in main window on send to show changed flags.
- Possibly display the message send results popup in the Main Window.
