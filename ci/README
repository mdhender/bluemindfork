Continuous integration scripts
==============================

Our hudson set up runs ${WORKSPACE}/ci/hudson.sh

${WORKSPACE} is the root of git checkout.

In our current setup, ${WORKSPACE} is
/var/lib/hudson/jobs/bm-master-main-deb/workspace/ in the KVM vm hudson.

Build slaves
============

hudson-slave is an init script for starting hudson slave build
executors. It is used by our tbird.buffy.kvm builder.

slave.jar can be downloaded from hudson itself.

The documentation to setup build slaves is here :
