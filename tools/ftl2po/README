The files freemarker-templates/*.po are a collection of all ftl templates
contained in the BlueMind project, so that they can be localized using
weblate.

The commands "ftl2po.py collect" and "ftl2po.py export" are used for
the conversion. Merging is not handled in case of simultanous editing
through weblate and through code.

There is no implicit merge strategy. Use with caution!
