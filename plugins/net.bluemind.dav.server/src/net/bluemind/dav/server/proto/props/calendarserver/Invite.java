/**
 * 
 * Purpose: Used to show to whom a calendar has been shared.
 * 
 * Protected: This property MUST be protected.
 * 
 * PROPFIND behavior: This property SHOULD NOT be returned by a PROPFIND allprop
 * request (as defined in Section 14.2 of [RFC4918]).
 * 
 * COPY/MOVE behavior: This property value MUST be preserved in COPY and MOVE
 * operations.
 * 
 * Description: This WebDAV property is present on a calendar collection
 * resource that has been shared by the owner, or on the calendar collection
 * resources of the sharees of the calendar. It provides a list of users to whom
 * the calendar has been shared, along with the "status" of the sharing invites
 * sent to each user. In addition, servers SHOULD include a CS:organizer XML
 * element on calendar collection resources of the sharees to provide clients
 * with a fast way to determine who the sharer is. A server's local privacy
 * policy may prevent sharees from knowing about other sharees on a shared
 * calendar. If that is so server will not include CS:user XML elements for
 * other sharees.
