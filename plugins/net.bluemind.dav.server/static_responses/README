The files you put here will end up in
/usr/share/bm-dav-data/static_responses/

They are used when a dav request always has the same response. We put
them on the filesystem instead of serving the response from java to be
able to use sendFile and benefit from linux sendfile support.

To use dav on your host in eclipse (assuming tom is your user) (yes
this is also a reminder for me):

sudo mkdir /usr/share/bm-dav-data
sudo chown tom /usr/share/bm-dav-data/
cd /usr/share/bm-dav-data/
ln -s /Users/tom/git/blue-project/plugins/net.bluemind.dav.server/static_responses .
